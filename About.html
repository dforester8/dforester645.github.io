            <p>Favorite Fantasy/RPGs: Minecraft and Pok√©mon bring a unique sense of adventure that make me feel like a kid again. These games do a great job at giving the player freedoms that allow each playthrough to be different than the last. Games like The Witcher and Skyrim bring a more structured and developed plot that allow players to explore every inch of the intricate world they have created. These games also revolve around much more mature themes, making the decisions players make more unforgiving than trivial games such as Mario, but the gameplay is arguably much more rewarding. </p>

        	<h1>Favorite Sports Games: Fifa and 2K basketball are two of my most played video games. While the games themselves may not be the best quality, they offer the best sports experience of any basketball or soccer game on the market. With the new gen around the corner, my hopes for a vastly improved sports game are sky high. I truly believe these games will take a huge jump when the new consoles come out. </h1>

        	<h1>Why I enjoy playing video games: I believe video games offer people a method of living out their dreams or fantasies in a way that is generally attainable for everyone. Video games are also much more interative than simply sitting down and watching TV. It allows people to put aside their daily troubles and stress and take their minds to another world. </h1>
